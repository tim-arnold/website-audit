# Accessibility Audit

## Context

You are conducting a WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility audit for the client described in `../CLAUDE.md`. Read that file first — it has the public URL, local site path, CMS, and any prior audit findings to be aware of.

The goal is to document accessibility issues the dev team must fix in the rebuild.

**Do NOT modify any files** in the WordPress installation or on the live site. Read and observe only.

## Deliverables

- `data/accessibility-findings.md` — structured findings from both passes
- `reports/accessibility-audit-report.md` — dev-team report
- `screenshots/` — visual evidence from the live audit

---

## Two-Pass Approach

Run both passes. They can run in parallel since they use different tools.

---

## Pass 1: Code-Level Audit (Filesystem)

Read the templates at the local site path in `../CLAUDE.md`. If no local path is available, note it and proceed with Pass 2 only.

Check for:

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure
- **Heading hierarchy** — H1 → H2 → H3 with no skips. Every page must have exactly one H1.
- **Landmark elements** — `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`. Multiple `<nav>` elements must have `aria-label` to distinguish them.
- **List markup** — navigation and repeated items should use `<ul>`/`<ol>`

### 2. Images and Media
- `alt` attributes on all `<img>` tags — check both hardcoded and dynamic (CMS image fields rendered in templates)
- Decorative images must have `alt=""`
- `<noscript>` image fallbacks — do they propagate the alt value or default to empty?
- `<video>` and `<iframe>` embeds — captions, transcripts, or accessible fallbacks
- SVG accessibility — `<title>` and `role="img"` for informative SVGs

### 3. Forms
- Label/input associations (`for`/`id` pairing)
- Error message handling and ARIA live regions
- Required field indicators

### 4. Interactive Elements
- Navigation menus — keyboard accessibility, ARIA attributes, mobile menu toggle
- Accordions, tabs, modals, dropdowns — ARIA roles, keyboard handlers (`Enter` AND `Space`), focus management, `aria-expanded`
- Links vs buttons — `<a>` tags should navigate; `<button>` elements should trigger actions. Flag any `<div>`/`<span>`/`<a>` used as interactive controls.
- Carousels — named prev/next controls, pause mechanism

### 5. Color and Contrast
- Check CSS for color values. Flag text/background combinations that look potentially low-contrast for live testing.
- Color-only state indicators (hover, active, error states)

### 6. Focus Management
- `outline: none` or `outline: 0` without replacement focus styles
- `:focus` and `:focus-visible` styles — are they visible and high-contrast?
- `tabindex` values greater than 0

### 7. ARIA Usage
- All `aria-*` and `role` attributes in templates
- Flag misuse: `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements, redundant roles, `aria-expanded` on wrong element

### 8. Page Structure
- Skip-to-content link present and functional?
- `<html lang>` attribute set?
- Viewport meta tag — `user-scalable=no` or `maximum-scale=1` are WCAG violations

## Pass 2: Live Audit (Playwright)

Use the Playwright MCP to test the live site. Test at minimum:
- Homepage
- The highest-traffic content page (from SEO audit, or the most representative page)
- A content detail page (article, product, profile, etc.)
- A page with a form
- A page with interactive components (accordion, tabs, modal)

For each page:

1. **Screenshot** (`browser_take_screenshot`) — visual evidence, save to `screenshots/`
2. **Accessibility tree snapshot** (`browser_snapshot`) — heading structure, landmark regions, image alt text
3. **Keyboard navigation** — press Tab repeatedly, take screenshots at key stops. Verify:
   - Focus indicator is visible at every stop
   - Focus order is logical (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
   - Skip link appears and works
4. **Heading structure** — extract all headings from the snapshot and verify hierarchy
5. **Landmark regions** — confirm `main`, `nav`, `header`, `footer` are present
6. **Image alt text** — check all `figure` and `img` elements in the snapshot for accessible names
7. **Interactive elements** — click/activate any accordions, modals, or dropdowns. Then test keyboard activation (Tab to focus, Enter and Space to activate). Take screenshots.
8. **Console errors** — note any JS errors that could affect AT functionality

If any page is inaccessible or errors out, note it and move on.

## Findings File: `data/accessibility-findings.md`

Organize by WCAG 2.2 principle:

**1. Perceivable** — text alternatives, captions, contrast, text resize
**2. Operable** — keyboard, timing, seizures, navigation
**3. Understandable** — readable, predictable, input assistance
**4. Robust** — parsing, name/role/value

For each finding:
- WCAG criterion (e.g., `1.1.1 Non-text Content`)
- Severity: Critical / Major / Minor
- Source: Code / Live / Code + Live
- Location: file path and/or URL + element
- Description
- Remediation recommendation

Include a summary table at the end.

---

## Report: `reports/accessibility-audit-report.md`

Structure:

**Executive Summary** — 5-7 bullets: overall posture, biggest issues, quick wins

**1. WCAG 2.2 Compliance Summary**
Table: each WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA criterion — Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Tested

**2. Critical Issues** — must fix; block or severely impair access

**3. Major Issues** — should fix; degrade experience significantly

**4. Minor Issues** — nice to fix; best-practice violations

**5. Component-Specific Findings**
Tables per component: navigation, primary content template(s), forms, any maps or complex widgets, footer

**6. Rebuild Recommendations**
- ARIA patterns to adopt for interactive components
- Heading structure plan (cross-reference SEO audit if headings were flagged there)
- Testing process: automated (axe/Lighthouse in CI), keyboard walk, screen reader testing
- Key acceptance criteria checklist for the new build

---

## Formatting Notes

- Include WCAG criterion numbers — the dev team will use these as acceptance criteria
- Be specific: file paths, line numbers, CSS selectors, URLs
- Severity ratings should be consistent and defensible
- Cross-reference SEO audit findings where they overlap (heading structure, page titles, structured data)
